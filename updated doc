## :question: What is FizzBuzz?

Quick summary:

> FizzBuzz is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three it prints “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five, it prints “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints “FizzBuzz”.

## :question: What do you mean by "creative" solutions?

Well, I'm not looking for normal solutions. You know, the ones you'd find in a book or so. I'm looking for something interesting! Whether that's a fancy one-liner in the language of your choice, or perhaps a funny [eso-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), or maybe an intentionally weird solution that you don't even quite understand yourself (be sure to document those!). Anyhow, the goal is to have fun and maybe even learn a thing or two. 

**Happy hacking!**
